## Features

* Configure path and relevant violations from the workflow YAML file
* Reports failures using the GitHub Checks API for rich annotations in your pull request
* Plugins included: as well as reporting violations from [pycodestyle](https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes), also optionally run the checks from [flake8-breakpoint](https://github.com/afonasev/flake8-breakpoint), [flake8-bugbear](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear) and [flake8-logging-format](https://github.com/globality-corp/flake8-logging-format).
